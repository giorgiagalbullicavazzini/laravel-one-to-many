# Project Portfolio

## Roadmap

- [x] Include an image upload option in the project creation form
- [x] Print the image from a project that includes one
- [x] Create a JS snippet to preview the uploaded images - when the user modifies the image, the preview changes accordingly
- [x] Add the preview snippet and the opportunity to upload images to the edit form
- [x] The user has the option of uploading an image or not doing so
- [x] Remove a picture before replacing it
- [x] The project image is also destroyed when a project is deleted
- [x] Don't print an image if a project doesn't have one
